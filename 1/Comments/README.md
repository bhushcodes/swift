# Comments in Swift

## Introduction:

Our own code can quickly become difficult to understand when we return to it. Hence, it's often useful to leave notes or reminders for our future selves or other developers.

## Types of Comments:

### Single Line Comment:

Denoted by two forward slashes //.

#### Example:

```swift
// Prints "hi"
print("hi")
```

Can also be used after a line of code:

```swift
print("hi")  // Prints "hi"
```

## Multiline Comment:

Denoted by /_ to begin the comment and _/ to end the comment.

#### Example:

```swift
/* This is all commented out.
print("hi")
```

None of this is going to run! \*/
Practice Exercise:
Let's practice adding a comment.

Create a single line comment with // followed by your favorite emoji, and then type the following code:

```swift
// üòä This is my favorite emoji
print("Codecademy")
```
