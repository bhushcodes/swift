# Swift If Statement

## Introduction:

The `if` statement is a fundamental conditional statement in Swift. It allows for the execution of a code block only if a specified condition is true.

### Instructions:

#### 1. Declare Variable:

-Declare a variable named `learningToCode` using the `var` keyword and assign it a boolean value of `true`.

```swift
var learningToCode = true
```

#### 2. Setup If Statement:

- Set up an `if` statement that uses `learningToCode` as its condition.
- Within the `if` statement's code block, print the message "Don't forget to take breaks! You got this."

```swift
if learningToCode {
    print("Don't forget to take breaks! You got this.")
}
```

#### 3. Reassign Variable Value:

- Reassign the value of `learningToCode` to `false` after the initial variable declaration but before the `if` statement.

```swift
learningToCode = false
```

#### 4. Observation:

Observe what happens when you run the program. Check if the message gets printed based on the value of `learningToCode`.

## Explanation:

- `var learningToCode = true`: Declares a variable named `learningToCode` and assigns it a boolean value of `true`.

- `if learningToCode { print("Don't forget to take breaks! You got this.") }`: Sets up an `if` statement with the condition `learningToCode`. If the condition is `true`, the message is printed.

- `learningToCode = false`: Reassigns the value of `learningToCode` to `false`.

- Observing the program's behavior helps understand how the `if` statement reacts to different conditions.

This program demonstrates the use of an `if` statement to execute code based on a specified condition.#
