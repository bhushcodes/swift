## Swift Else Statement

### Introduction:

The else statement in Swift is used in conjunction with an if statement to execute a block of code when the condition of the if statement is false. It provides an alternative path of execution when the initial condition is not met.

### Instructions:

#### Declare Variable:

Declare a variable named `wearGlasses` and assign it a Boolean value (true or false) based on whether you wear glasses or not.

```swift
var wearGlasses = true // Update with your actual status
```

#### Setup If/Else Statement:

Create an if/else statement that checks the value of `wearGlasses`.
If `wearGlasses` is true, print the message "I wear glasses."
Otherwise, print the message "I don‚Äôt wear glasses."

```swift
if wearGlasses {
    print("I wear glasses.")
} else {
    print("I don‚Äôt wear glasses.")
}
```

#### Explanation:

- `var wearGlasses = true`: Declares a variable named `wearGlasses` and assigns it a Boolean value (true or false) based on whether you wear glasses or not. Update with your actual status.
- `if wearGlasses { print("I wear glasses.") } else { print("I don‚Äôt wear glasses.") }`: Checks the value of `wearGlasses`. If `wearGlasses` is true, it prints "I wear glasses."; otherwise, it prints "I don‚Äôt wear glasses."

This program demonstrates the use of an else statement to provide an alternative code path when the condition of the preceding if statement is false.
