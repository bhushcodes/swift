# Swift Variables and Type Annotations

## Introduction:

Type annotations in Swift allow us to explicitly specify the type of a variable, providing clarity about the kind of values the variable can store. Basic data types include `Int` for integer numbers, `Double` for floating-point numbers, `String` for sequences of characters, and `Bool` for true/false values.

## Instructions:

#### 1. Declare a String Variable:

Declare a variable named `book` with the type `String` and a value of "Just Kids".

```swift
var book: String = "Just Kids"
```

#### 2. Declare an Int Variable:

Declare a variable named `pageCount` with the type `Int` and a value of 278.

```swift
var pageCount: Int = 278
```

#### Explanation:

- var book: String = "`Just Kids`": Declares a variable named `book` with the type `String` and initializes it with the value "Just Kids".

- var pageCount: `Int = 278`: Declares a variable named pageCount with the type `Int` and initializes it with the value `278`.

These type annotations help make the code more explicit and conform to Swift's strong typing, ensuring that variables are used in a way consistent with their declared types.
