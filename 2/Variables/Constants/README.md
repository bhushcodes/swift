# Swift Constants

## Introduction:

In Swift, constants are used to store values that should not be changed after being assigned. Constants are declared using the `let` keyword, providing a way to ensure immutability for specific values.

#### Instructions:

##### Declare a Constant for Months:

Declare a constant named `months` and assign it the number of months that end with "y".

```swift
let months = 7 // Example: January, February, May, July, August, October, December
```

##### Explanation:

- `let months = 7`: Declares a constant named `months` and assigns it the value `7`, representing the number of months that end with the letter "y" (e.g., January, February, May, July, August, October, December).

Constants are beneficial for ensuring the integrity of specific values that should remain unchanged during the program's execution. They contribute to program safety by preventing unintended modifications.
