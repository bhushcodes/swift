# Introduction to Variables

## Purpose of Variables:

The `"Hello, world!"` program only outputs information and doesn't interact with user input or perform calculations.
Real programs often require processing input to produce meaningful results.

## Role of Variables:

Variables are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a computer's memory.
They provide a way to dynamically work with information during program execution.

### Definition of a Variable:

A variable is a name that represents a specific location in the computer's memory allocated for storing and retrieving data.

### Data Types:

`Int`: Represents integer numbers.

`Double`: Represents floating-point numbers.

`String`: Represents a sequence of characters.

`Bool`: Represents true/false values.

### Variable Types:

Every variable has a type that defines the kind of information it can store.
The type guides the compiler in allocating memory and specifies permissible operations on the variable.

### Types of Data:

Integers, decimals, text, and boolean values are common types of data handled by variables.
