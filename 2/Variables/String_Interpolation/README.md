# Swift Variables and String Interpolation

## Introduction:

String interpolation in Swift allows us to insert values into a string. We can use the syntax `\(value)` to embed the value directly within the string.

#### Instructions:

1. Declare a Variable for Age:

Inside `String.swift`, declare a variable named `age` and set it equal to your age.

```swift
var age = 25 // Replace 25 with your actual age
```

2. String Interpolation:

Use `print()` and string interpolation to output the message "I am [age] years old," where `[age]` represents the value of the variable `age`.

```swift
print("I am \(age) years old.")
```

Explanation:

- `var age = 25`: Declares a variable named age and initializes it with your age (replace `25` with your actual age).
- `print("I am \(age) years old.")`: Uses string interpolation to insert the value of the variable `age` into the string. The output will be "I am [your age] years old."

This demonstrates how to dynamically include variable values within a string using Swift's string interpolation feature.
