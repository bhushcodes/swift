# Swift Variables and Arithmetic Operators

## Introduction:

Now that we have declared variables, let's explore how to perform calculations using arithmetic operators.

### Arithmetic Operators:

`+`Addition

`-` Subtraction

`*` Multiplication

`/` Division

`%` Modulo (divides and gives the remainder)

### Example:

```swift

var score = 0
// score is 0

score = 4 + 2
// it is now 6

score = score - 2
// it is now 4

score = 4 * 2
// it is now 8

score = 4 / 2
// and now 2

score = 5 % 2
// and now 1
```

#### Note:

The order of operations can be specified using parentheses.
For example, using parentheses in `score = 4 * (2 + 1)` sets score equal to `4 * 3` rather than `8 + 1`.

## Instructions:

#### Declaration of Amount:

Declare and initialize a variable called `amount`.

```swift
var amount = 100.0
```

#### Calculating Tip:

Declare a new variable named `tip` and give it the value of `amount` multiplied by `0.2`.

```swift
var tip = amount * 0.2
```

#### Printing Tip:

Print out the value of `tip`.

```swift
print(tip)
```

#### Explanation:

- `var amount = 100.0`: Declares a variable named `amount` and initializes it with the value `100.0`.

- `var tip = amount * 0.2`: Declares a new variable named `tip` and assigns it the value of `amount` multiplied by `0.2`.

- `print(tip)`: Outputs the value of the variable `tip`. The actual tip value depends on the initial value of `amount`.
