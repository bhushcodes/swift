# Declare a Variable and Output Its Value

```swift
// Step 1: Declare a variable named year with a value of the current year.
var year = 2024

// Explanation:

// - 'var' is a keyword used to declare variables.
// - 'year' is the name of the variable.
// - '=' is the assignment operator.
// - '2024' is the value assigned to the variable 'year'.

// Step 2: Output year using print().
print(year)

// Explanation:
// - 'print(year)' outputs the value of the variable 'year'.
// - The output would be the current year, in this case, '2024'.
```

### In this Swift code snippet:

`var year = 2024`: Declares a variable named `year` and assigns it the value `2024`.
`print(year)`: Outputs the value of the variable `year` using the `print()` function. The output, in this case, would be the current year, which is `2024`.

This code demonstrates the basics of declaring a variable, assigning a value to it, and printing the variable's value to the console.
